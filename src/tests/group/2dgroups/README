This directory contains:

1) Files containing the generators for all of the 2D plane groups.
   The file name of each of these is the name of the corresponding
   group. Each such file contains only the 'generators' of the group,
   i.e., a minimum list of the symmetry elements from which the rest
   of the group can be constructed by multipication of symmetry 
   elements. The complete group is constructed by the make_group
   routine in new_2groups.f. 

2) A program new_2dgroups, which was used to generate the case select
    statement for these groups in the space_groups routine in module
    space_groups_mod

3) A file driver that is the driver file for new_2dgroups
