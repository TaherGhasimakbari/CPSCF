 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007) David C. Morse

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile the program:

1. Install the open source LAPACK linear algebra library and the 
FFTW fast fourier transform library.  The program can use either 
version 2 or version 3 of the FFTW library.  

2. Edit the Makefile in the src/build directory. You will need to
set the following variables to values appropriate to your operating
system and preferences:

     F90       = executable for Fortran 90 compiler
     FAST      = compiler options for high optimization
     NOPT      = compiler options for no optimization
     LAPACKLIB = directory containing LAPACK libraries
     FFTWLIB   = directory containing FFTW library
     FFT_FILE  = fft2_mod for FFTW v2 or fft3_mod for v3
     DEVEL     = empty string for stable version (see Makefile)
     BIN       = directory to which executable should be written
     EXE       = name of executable file

Appropriate values for some compilers and common locations are
provided in notes within the Makefile.  The values of the macro 
variables SCF, SRC, and FORPEDO use relative paths that rely on 
the directory structure of the package, and should not need to be 
reset.

The code can be linked with either version 2 or version 3 of the
FFTW library.  Because the interfaces of the different versions 
of FFTW are different, two different fortran 90 modules, named
fft2_mod and fft3_mod, are provided as wrappers for versions 2
and 3 of FFTW, respectively. The choice of which of these modules 
to compile and link is controlled by the value of the Makefile 
macro variable FFT_FILE, which should be set to either 'fft2_mod' 
or 'fft3_mod'.

3. To compile, issue the command:

   > make pscf

   from within the src/build directory.  This will fill the src/build 
   directory with *.o and *.mod files and create an executable file
   $(BIN)/$(EXE).
		      
4. If desired, to remove all of the generated *.o, *.mod and files 
   from the src/build directory, as well as any *~ files from src 
   and its subdirectories, enter the command

   > make clean

5. NOTE: Before modifying any of the source files, read the 
discussion at the end of the src/SRC_FILES file regarding the use 
of a python preprocessor script (FORPEDO) to automatically generate 
some fortran files from preprocessor input files.
