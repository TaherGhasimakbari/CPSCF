This is a dummy file.

It is added to the CVS repository only to keep CVS from pruning an 
otherwise empty test directory when the package is exported. An empty 
'test' directory is included with each example as a default destination 
for the files produced by running the example. 

This file can be safely removed from the distributed package when it is 
no longer under CVS revision control.
