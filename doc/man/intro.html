PSCF is a numerical implementation of the Edwards-Helfand 
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for periodic phases formed by 
liquids containing block copolymers. It is designed to describe 
any periodic structures with 1, 2, or 3 dimensional periodicity of 
incompessible liquids that may contain a mixture of block copolymers, 
homopolymers, and small molecule solvents. It can describe periodic
structure structures with any unit cell (e.g., cubic, orthorhombic, 
triclinic, etc.) with any specified space group symmetry. The 
modified diffusion equation (MDE) is solved with an efficient 
pseudo-spectral method. The code was designed for calculating
phase diagrams by comparing free energies of competing ordered 
phases, and contains features that facilitate such calculations.

In addition to its primary purpose of solving the SCF equations, 
PSCF can also calculate the linear susceptibility of ordered 
phases. This is an efficient pseudo-spectral implementation of 
the linear response theory of An-Chang Shi and coworkers.

<b>Documentation:</b>
<ul>
<li> This manual </li>
<li> API documentation. The package includes HTML documentation of all 
     public module variables and procedures, which is extracted from 
     comment blocks in the source code.</li>
<li> Examples of converged solutions and input scripts are included.</li>

<p>
<b>Dependencies:</b>
</p> <p>
The program is written in Fortran 90. It depends the open source FFTW Fast 
Fourier Transform library and the LAPACK linear algebra library. To compile 
the code from source, you will thus need a Fortran 90 compiler and these 
two libraries.</p>
