<h3>Input Files</h3>

<p>
The main program requires two input files: An input script and a 
input "omega" file that contains an initial guess for the monomer 
chemical potential field. The path for the omega file is specified
in the input script.
</p>

<p>
The input script contains the parameters and instructions required
to run a calculation. This file is read by the program from standard 
input.  The syntax for executing the program, if the executable is 
called pscf, is thus
<pre>
   pscf < in > log
</pre>
Here, "in" is the name of the input script, and "log" is a file to 
which we have redirected messages emitted by the program during 
operation.  The command 'pscf &lt; in' will cause these messages 
to be printed to the screen. The 
<a href="sec.php?section=Input Script&">format of the input script</a>
is described in the next page of this manual.
</p>

<p>
The input omega file contains an initial guess for the SCF monomer 
chemical potential fields. The name of this file must end with the suffix 
'omega'.  The input script contains a variable named 'input_prefix' that 
must prepended to omega to obtain the full file name or path.  For example 
if input_prefix is an empty string, the full filename is simply 'omega'.  
If input_prefix = 'in.', then the filename is 'in.omega'.  In order to 
read a file in a different directory, set input_prefix to the path to 
that directory, including a trailing directory separator.  For example 
if input_prefix = '../previous_run/', then the program will read the 
file '../previous_run/omega' in a sister directory. 
</p>

<h3>Output Files</h3>
<p>
The program creates several types of output files. The paths to 
these files are generated by appending standard suffixes to the 
value of a string variable 'output_prefix' that must be specified 
in the input script. As for 'input_prefix', these files may be
placed in another directory by setting output_prefix to the path
to the desired directory, with a trailing directory separator.
</p>
<p>
Running a solution of the SCF equations for a single set of 
parameters creates the following types of output files:
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th width="16%"> File Suffix </th>
    <th> File Contents </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> *out   </td> 
    <td> Output summary </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td> *rho   </td> 
    <td> Monomer concentration fields </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td> *omega </td> 
    <td> Monomer chemical potential fields </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td> *waves </td> 
    <td> Information about plane waves and basis functions </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
The same file format is used for rho and omega output files, both of 
which describe fields. Each field file contains a lists of coefficients 
of symmetry adapted basis functions, in which each such basis function 
is a sum of plane waves that are related by symmetry. The format, and 
the use of symmetry adapted basis functions to represent fields, is
described in more detail 
<a href="sec.php?section=Field Files&">here</a>.
