This file format contains a header, which has a format similar to 
that of the input script, followed by a section that contains 
coefficients of basis functions that are used to expand the field.
</p>
<p>
The first line in the header simply specifies a number for the file 
format being used (file format v1.0). The remaining several lines of 
the header contain information about the crystal structure that is 
required to interpret the field file (i.e., the dimensionality of 
the periodicity, the crystal system, the unit cell parameters, and 
the space group). The above example is for a lamellar structure with 
inversion symmetry (space group -1). This followed by the number 
N_monomer of different monomer types, and the number N_star of basis 
functions (or "stars") used to expand the solution.
</p>

<p>
The actually fields are specified after this header in N_monomer
columns of coefficients of symmetry-adapted basis functions. 
Each of the first N_monomer columns in the remainder of the file
contains the coefficients of symmetry adapted basis functions in
the expansion of a field component (in this case, a volume fraction 
field) for one monomer type. The first column is thus a list of
coefficients of basis functions for the volume fraction of monomer
type 1, and the second column a corresponding list for monomer 
type 2. 
</p>

<p>
Each symmetry adapted basis function is a real function with the 
space group symmetry specified in the file header, and is constructed 
as a superposition of plane waves with wavevectors of equal magnitude 
that are related by the symmetry elements of the space group or (in
crystals that have no inversion center) by inversion. In a cubic
crystal, such a set of basis vectors all have Miller indices that are 
related to one another by permutations and/or sign changes, e.g.,
(1,2,3), (3,2,1), (-3,2,1), etc. These basis functions are 
constructed automatically using an algorithm that is described in 
..... In the one dimensional example given here, the basis functions 
are all proportional to cosines, and the first is a constant function. 
</p>

<p> Each basis function in a dimensional crystal is uniquely 
identified by a set of Miller indices, corresponding to the Miller 
indices for one of the plane waves in the basis functions.  The 
conventions for choosing which plane wave to use to identify
the basis function is discussed in the comments provided in the
source code of crystal_mod (See the developers manual for
browseable version of this. The set of Miller indices output
to file corresponds to the value of the variable wave_of_star.) 
The set of Miller indices for each basis function is listed in the 
dim columns after the coefficients.  For our one-dimensional 
example, the single Miller index for each basis function is 
listed in the third column, and the values are consecutive 
integers.
</p>

<p>
The last column in each field component line is the number of
distinct symmetry-related wavevectors used to construct that 
basis function. In the above example, the first basis function
contains only the k=0 wavevector, and so this value is 1, while
all the others are cosine-like functions constructed from two
plane waves, so this value is 2. In a cubic crystal, this number
could be as high as 48 for a set of plane waves with three 
distinct Miller indices.
</p>

<p>
Our conventions for the coefficients of plane waves within the
definition of a basis function are simple to describe for the most 
common case of centrosymmetric crystals (which includes all of 
the known equilibrium phases of diblock copolymers). In this case, 
each basis function is a superposition superposition of a set of 
plane waves that are related by elements of the space group 
(rotations, reflections through a plane, etc.), also known as a 
"star". In a cubic crystal, each star contains plane waves for
which the Miller indices are related by permutations and/or 
sign changes.  In a centrosymmetric crystal, the coefficient 
of each plane wave is real, and is the same as that of the plane 
wave to which it is related by inversion. In some centro-symmetric 
space groups (including the Ia-3d group of the gyroid phase), the 
signs of the coefficients are different for different such pairs 
of plane waves within a star. The coefficients are chosen so that 
the sum of the squares of the coefficients of all the plane waves 
in the star is equal to 1. For our example of a centrosymmetric
lamellar phase, the first basis function is thus unity (indepdent
of position), and all the others are sqrt(2) times a cosine
function. 
<p>

<p>
The construction of basis functions for non-centrosymmetric 
space groups is complicated by the fact that the basis functions 
should be real to describe real fields. When the crystal has
no inversion symmetry, a basis function that is constructed 
by superposing plane waves that are related by symmetry 
elements of the space group will generally not be proportional
to a real function. The simplest example of this is a one 
dimensional crystal with no inversion symmetry (group 1), 
and thus no symmetry elements other than the identity. In
this case, no plane wave is related to any other by symmetry. 
The natural basis functions, from the point of view of symmetry
alone, are single complex exponential plane waves, but these
are complex functions of position.  In order to construct basis 
functions that are real, in this example, one must construct
two real superpositions of each pair of plane waves that are 
related by inversion (which is not a symmetry of the crystal).
The required basis functions in this case are both cosine
and sine functions. More generally, to form real basis 
functions in crystals with no inversion symmetry, we use 
generalizations of the cosine and sign functions that are 
construction by constructing two different superpositions 
of "stars" that are related to one another by inversion. Our
conventions used for doing this are described best in the 
comments in the source code. 
</p>

<p> 
The fact that this file format makes use of an expansion
in symmetry-adapted basis functions does not imply that 
this is how fields are represented throughout the program. 
The representation in terms of symmetry-adapted basis
functions is used only for file IO, and for iteration of
the solutions, in order to construct field updates that 
preserve the imposed symmetry by construction.  Within 
the inner loop of the pseudospectral algorithm that is
used to solve the modified diffusion equation, however, 
fields are stored on an regular FFT grid, in terms of 
either values at grid points or coefficients of plane 
waves, with no explicitly imposed symmetry. 
</p>

<p> 
In order to visualize the fields, it is generally necessary
to run the program using an input script with a section header 
FIELD_TO_GRID. This read in a field that is stored in the 
above file format and outputs a file in which the field is 
represented in terms of the values of the field at evenly 
spaced grid points.
