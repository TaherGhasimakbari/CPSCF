<p>
The src directory contains the source files for scf code for
periodic structures of incompressible blend of linear block 
copolymers, homopolymers, and small molecule solvent. The code 
is compiled from the src/build directory, using the Makefile 
in the directory.  
</p>

<p>
To compile the code, you will have to cd to src/build, edit the 
Makefile, and issue the command 'make pscf' from within src/build.
These steps are described in more detail below
</p>

<p>
<b>Customize the Makefile:</b>
</p>
<p>
In Makefile in the src/build directory, you will need to set 
values for a set of macro variables to values appropriate to your 
system. The variables you may need to reset are:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>SCF </td>
    <td>root of scf directory tree.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SRC </td>
    <td>F90 source file directory. Default: $(SCF)/src</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BIN      </td>
    <td>directory to which executable should be written</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EXE      </td>
    <td>name of executable file</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F90      </td>
    <td>path to executable for Fortran 90 compiler</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FAST</td>
    <td>compiler options for high optimization</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NOPT</td>
    <td>compiler options for no optimization</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LAPACKLIB</td>
    <td>directory with Lapack libraries</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FFTWLIB</td>
    <td>directory with FFTW library</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
<b>Compile and Link:</b>
</p>
To compile and link, from the src/build directory, issue the 
command
<pre>
   > make pscf
</pre>
This should fill the src/build directory with *.o and *.mod files,
and create an executable $(BIN)/$(EXE)
</p>
	
<p>
<b>Cleaning Up</b>
</p>	      
To remove all of the *.o amd *.mod files from the src/build
directory, as well as all *~ files from src and its subdirectory,
if desired, enter the command
<pre>
   > make clean
</pre>
