<p>
The variables in the UNIT_CELL section of the input script specfy 
the dimensionality dim of the crystal (which must be 1, 2, or 3), 
the crystal system (e.g., cubic, tetragonal, etc. for 3D crystals), 
the number of parameters N_cell_param required to specify the size 
and shape of the unit cell for that crystal system (e.g., 1 for a 
cubic lattice and 6 for a triclinic cell), and a list cell_param 
of N_cell_param parameters. Listed below are the allowed 
crystal system names, along with the required value for N_cell_param 
and the meanings of the elements of the cell_param array.

<h3>1D Crystal Systems</h3>
<p>
The only allowed crystal system name for a one-dimensional 
crystal is 'lamellar'. 
</p>

<hr/>

<h3>2D Crystal Systems</h3>
<p>
For two dimensional crystals (dim=2), the parameters a and b are
the lengths of the two Bravais lattice vectors, and gamma is the
angle between them, in radians.

<h3>3D Crystal Systems</h3>
<p>
For three dimensional crystals (dim=3), the parameters a, b, and c 
are the lengths of the three Bravais lattice vectors, alpha is the 
angle between b and c, beta is the angle between c and a, and gamma 
is the angle between a and b.
