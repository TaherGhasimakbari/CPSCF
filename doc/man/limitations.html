<p>
The program has some limitations as the result of choices made in its 
design. Some are easily fixable and others would require more work, as
discussed below:
<ul>
<li><em>PSCF is not parallelized:</em> The fact that it runs on only 
one processor limits the size of the problems it can handle. On a modern
Linux workstation with 1-2 GB RAM, it can handle most three dimensional 
structures on grids with up to 64 x 64 x 64 elements.  We will consider 
parallelizing the solution of the modified diffusion equation if the 
program gains users, and there appears to be interest in using it for 
larger problems. (So please let us know if you find it useful!)
</li>

<li><em>Robustness of Iteration Scheme:</em> 
The quasi-Newton iteration scheme that we have used thus far converges 
extremely rapidly when given a good initial guess. This is what we need 
for efficient exploration of phase diagrams. The algorithm is not 
particularly robust, however, and will fail to converge if given a poor 
initial guess for the chemical potential fields. We plan to add a more 
robust (but slower) relaxation scheme as an alternative. 
</li>

<li><em>Memory Constraints:</em> 
Our current implementation of the quasi-Newton iteration scheme is a 
memory hog: The memory usage scales like the square of the number of
symmetrized basis functions needed to represent the solution. This has 
not yet dominated the total memory usage in problems of interest to us, 
for problems in which the solution of the modified diffusion equation 
fits in the 1-2GB RAM available on a single processor. Nonetheless, we 
plan to fix this in an upcoming release. 
</li>
</ul>
